# Parkinson-s-Disease-Prediction-Model

📌 Overview
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder affecting movement and speech. Early detection can help improve patient outcomes. This project leverages machine learning to predict Parkinson’s disease using biomedical voice measurements.

🚀 Objective
Develop a predictive model for Parkinson’s disease detection.
Use machine learning algorithms to classify patients based on vocal biomarkers.
Improve early diagnosis using data-driven insights.
🔬 Dataset
The dataset used is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains voice measurements from individuals, including those diagnosed with Parkinson’s. Key features include:

MDVP (Measures of vocal frequency and amplitude)
Jitter, Shimmer (Voice irregularities)
HNR (Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio)
RPDE, DFA (Signal processing measures)

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python 🐍
Scikit-Learn 🤖
Pandas & NumPy 📊
Matplotlib & Seaborn 🎨
📊 Machine Learning Models

Implemented multiple ML algorithms to evaluate performance:
